## Background

I bought this car new in 2019 and for the first 4 years I kept it stock, aside from some exterior parts and a tune. The car was fun to drive but I was always wanting a little more out of it (as we all do). The stock setup with a tune has a nice midrange but falls off towards the top and leaves some to be desired. I've always been into cars growing up but never had a fun one, nor a modified one. I figured I should mod at least one car in my life and so this was it. The car has been paid off, warranty is expired, gas engines and sports cars as we know them are on their way out, our compact SUV EV overlords are coming for us all blah blah blah might as well do it now.

### Build Purpose

The STI S209 was pretty cool but also very expensive and more or less unobtainium. I later realized it was possible to buy most, if not all, of the suspension parts used in the S209. For those unfamiliar the S206, S207, S208, etc. were previously Japan only exclusives where they take an STI and focus on suspension tuning. Savagegeese described the S209 as the first Subaru they've driven that actually wanted to turn instead of plow straight ahead into a field. So I thought to myself why don't I just buy those parts and then add some of my own changes to make it my own. My original goals were to have something similar to the S209, use OEM parts where it made sense, make it fun to drive, and still stay as a street car without going too overboard.

**tl;dr:** I wanted to build some sort of wannabe S209 with more power and stick to OEM/STI parts where possible.

## Parts and Specs

_How to not have money._

### Engine

Good for ~380whp on pump gas at 19psi. Could probably do ~430whp on E85. Reliability mods and flex fuel with same power as pump gas to keep it alive for track abuse.

- AEM 340 Fuel Pump

### Drivetrain

Mostly tightens the drivetrain up a bit. Adds some minor NVH but I like the gear whine.

- STI Short Shifter
- STI Group N Pitch Stop
- STI Group N Transmission Mount
- Perrin Shifter Bushings
- Whiteline Transmission Crossmember Bushings
- Whiteline Differential Bushing Inserts
- Cusco Rear Differential Carrier

### Suspension

These are most of the S209 suspension parts. 2018+ STIs went from a 20mm rear swaybar to a 19mm but the S209 used a 20mm.

- STI Front Draw Stiffener
- STI Front Strut Brace
- STI Front Support Brace
- STI Rear Draw Stiffener
- STI Rear Subframe Brace
- STI Rear Lower Control Arm
- STI Rear Trailing Arm
- STI Rear Toe Arm

- Cygnus X1 Coilovers (8K/8K Swift springs, extended shock bodies)
- Whiteline Adjustable 20mm Rear Swaybar
- Whiteline Adjustable Front & Rear Endlinks

### Interior

Pretty simple here. Stock Recaros were nice for the street but were completely useless at holding me in when actually driving. Wouldn't recommend the extended armrest with a low seat.

- Subaru JDM Extended Armrest
- Subaru Ultrasuede Steering Wheel
- Sparco QRT-R Bucket Seat

### Exterior

Kept it OEM+ where I could.

- STI Front Lip
- STI Cherry Lip Skirt
- STI Canards
- SubieBros JDM Vented DRL Bezel
- STI Side Skirts
- STI Rear Spats
- STI Wing Gurney Flap
- Subispeed Red Grille Pinstripe

---

Tuned at Surgeline - 382whp/349wtq at 19psi on 92 octane. Could make a bit more but limited torque to ~350ft-lbs. I later added flex fuel but kept power the same for added knock protection and cooling for abuse. ID 1050x injectors are too small to safely make any more power anyway.

### Long Term Impressions

_That'll do pig, that'll do._

After 4 years of the car being basically stock, and currently 3 years of it being modified, overall I am pretty pleased with how the car turned out and I have no regrets. The car is much more fun to drive in terms of both power and handling while still being a reasonably good street car. The coilovers with spherical bearings, stiffer driveline bushings, and the rear suspension links also being spherical bearings all transmit more NVH into the cabin. While the car didn't have a quiet interior to begin with I wouldn't say this is unbearable by any means, it's just not "nice." None of this matters though once you start driving the car how you should drive it.

The engine is a night and day difference compared to stock. 380whp isn't a ton of power these days but it is definitely enough to have fun with. It makes all the right noises and has a pretty usable powerband. There is some turbo lag still but it's comparable to stock. I will say for autocross the stock turbo might be better in some ways with the same bolt-ons since it would probably spool sooner and probably make more mid-range torque. But on the street/track I think the Dom 1.5's better top-end power is worth it. It builds power all the way to redline. Sometimes I want more but then I have to remind myself that is a never-ending rabbit hole so I'm ignoring that for now.

Suspension wise the car feels much better in how it feels and how it drives. The stiffer bushings, additional bracing, etc. all help contribute to making your steering inputs feel more direct and immediate. The seat holds you in and you feel more through the car. Instead of wanting to push it's easier to get it to rotate. When you overdo it and kick the rear out it's easy to control. Despite having stiffer coilovers the overall ride quality is maybe marginally worse than stock IMO. I was worried it'd be horrible but it's not bad at all for what the car is.

So, all things considered, was it expensive? Yes. Could I have put this money into literally any other platform and made 1 million hp and been the first person in recorded human history to achieve a below 0 second 60-130mph Dragy time? Yes. But if you're into cars, especially modifying them, you already know the entire thing is a waste of money from the start but you do it because it's fun. Or at least that's why I do it. Lighting money on fire _is_ fun, right? At the end of the day, the car is fun to drive and it has been reliable. Wait, what?

So far after 7 years I've had to replace:

- An impact sensor in the driver side B pillar. It just randomly went out right after the warranty expired. But it was an easy fix.
- An IAG AOS check valve. They don't seem to last long.
- An e-clip on the wastegate arm when it suddenly left the chat one day.

That's it.

### Subaru Reliability

_Ah yes, everyone's favorite topic._

So far the car is still alive and I've spent the last 3 years beating the shit out of it in the mountains, at autox, and at the track. Conventional wisdom will have you believe that these cars blow up instantly when you look at them wrong. Which, does that happen? Yeah. The meme exists for a reason. Jokes aside, there are millions of these cars and I think it's also important to ask _why_ they blew up and _who_ is blowing them up?

EJs have some quirks and are more sensitive to certain things than other cars. This has all been well documented for nearly 2 decades and all of this knowledge is easily accessible. If you want to build a Subaru that doesn't blow up immediately, just do a quick google search and do some reading. Also talk to a tuner. IMO it basically comes down to this:

- Get a tune if you make significant changes to how air flows through the engine, especially if it's an intake.

- Find a tuner that actually knows how to tune Subarus. Your main goal here is to avoid knock, even more so on the stock pistons. Don't find one that's chasing dyno numbers for Instagram.

- Check your oil. Mine doesn't really burn much oil normally but it can burn a lot in certain scenarios. If you're going to get sticky tires and drive the car hard you will need to make some changes to the oiling system. Also check your PCV system occasionally (this is one of the "certain scenarios").

From what I have seen and heard, my feeling is that most people who blow up their STIs are either not maintaining it or they're doing something they shouldn't. People still to this day run intakes without a tune because it "runs fine so who cares." Yeah, it will run fine, until it won't.

#### Parts and Tunes

Why do these engines need tunes for some parts and other engines don't? Because it's a relatively simple MAF based system where the ECU makes a lot of assumptions about itself. All modern engines use a wideband O2 sensor to make fueling corrections so they can adjust to different conditions and so on. But for EJs this is only true at low engine loads. Once you're in boost the ECU can't make fueling corrections anymore and it has no idea what the actual AFR is. So when the ECU is calibrated to the engine and these assumptions are correct, it works completely fine. When you start changing stuff significantly and the ECU doesn't know about it, things may not be fine.

So why is that? For whatever reason, Subaru decided (probably for emissions) to put the wideband O2 sensor in the header before the turbo. The problem with doing that is when you're in boost and the header is pressurized wideband O2 sensors aren't accurate. So in that scenario the ECU goes into open loop fueling and ignores the wideband O2 sensor. This is where it just looks at the MAF sensor and some other things and goes "I think I have this much air so I'll inject this much fuel" and it has no way of checking AFR. Again, if the ECU is calibrated to the engine this works fine.

Now if you stick a new intake on and completely mess up the MAF scaling you're now playing with fire. It will probably be okay at low engine loads because the ECU will pick up that the fueling is off and make corrections via the wideband O2 sensor. So everything appears to be normal, assuming it's not so far off that it throws a CEL. However, under boost it can't do that and when it falls back to what it's tuned for it is likely running lean. Any turbo engine running lean in boost is going to have a bad time. Most newer turbo cars either use speed density or they have the wideband O2 sensor after the turbo where it should be so they can always make fueling corrections in all scenarios. This is why they can bolt on whatever they want without a tune. USDM EJs are not like this for whatever reason, it's just how it is.

tl;dr: Find a good tuner and listen to them. Get a tune if you are changing something big like the intake, turbo, or downpipe.

#### Oiling

The stock oiling system works fine for the street and driving around normally, and I think for the mountains it's probably fine too. There may be some long term reliability concerns around the oil pickup tube eventually cracking and failing. This seems like only maybe a concern on some older models, idk. If you are going to track the car though and/or run wide sticky 200tw tires this is where I think you will need to make upgrades to the oiling system for the engine to survive.

Under hard cornering oil can very easily slosh up into the valve cover drain ports and eventually start pooling up in the valve covers. It can also start making its way up through the valve cover breathers and through your PCV system. Now all that oil is either being sucked through your intake and being burnt (which also lowers octane) or it's pooling up in your AOS/catch cans. If you lose too much oil in your pan from this your oil pickup will end up sucking in air and then it's game over.

So how do you fix this? Well if you're rich you just buy a Porsche because they fixed this problem by going to a dry sump. Which, if you have a lot of money to blow, yeah you can get a dry sump oiling system for these engines too. If you talk to IAG they highly recommend going to a competition pan for track use, just something that is baffled with one-way flaps to try and keep oil around the oil pickup as much as possible. So that's what I did. I survived on just a normal Killer B oil pan for a couple years but now that I want to track the car more and get the fast 200tw tires I figured it would be a good idea to get a more serious oil pan.

Also if you're going to track the car you should get an oil cooler, otherwise you're fine without one.

#### Temperatures

This applies to any car but yeah just don't let it get too hot. Coolant should stay below 220F ideally and you don't want to be near 230F. Oil temperatures should be <250F ideally and you don't want to be near 270-280F. Keeping the engine cool during hard driving is never a bad idea.

### The Future

_How to continue not having money._

The car at this point is more or less finished I think. Anything more would either be even more expensive than it already is, or it'd just be turning into a track car. Plus I've already spent far too much money on this thing. This section used to be longer but I think I've done all that I want to do at the moment.

If I fully committed to hating money I would get a P2P racing closed-deck short block, ID 1300cc injectors, maybe GSC S1 cams and valves, and then max the turbo out for a usable ~450whp that I can beat on. Or get the newer Blouch 1.5 g2r turbo which sounds like it's good for 10-20 more whp. And then I would get some BBS RE-V7 wheels to finish it.

## Misc.

### Issues Encountered

_Can't do all this without at least one problem._

This section is mostly for things I ran into with whatever parts I installed.

#### Boost Creep

The Blouch Dom 1.5 is advertised as a turbo that won't have boost creep. In my experience that is absolutely not true. Maybe it's something to do with my build, I don't know. With the wastegate arm disconnected and wide open it will still build 8psi on pump gas. On the stock 15psi actuator it will build 19psi, up to 21 if it's 30F out. On a Turbosmart actuator with a 10lb spring it's anywhere from 13-16psi depending on how much ethanol you're running (more ethanol, more boost creep). I just live with it since it's not enough to be a problem. The actual fix is go with an external wastegate.

#### Killer B Oil Pan Leak

When the instructions say "very carefully insert the dipstick tube into the oil pan", you need to be extremely careful about it. Like go as slow as possible. I thought I was being careful but I ended up destroying an o-ring and there was a persistent small leak around where the dipstick tube enters the oil pan. Pulling an oil pan to reseat it was far too much of a pain in the ass to deal with so I just left it. It wasn't enough to become an issue but it was annoying. IAG has a better design around this IMO.

## Misc. Notes

This is broken up into two sections: Parts and Installation.

## Parts

Random notes for why I picked some parts and/or my experiences with them so far.

### Arm rests

If you are an adult that is larger than the size of a baby then the JDM extended armrest is an absolute must if you want a functional armrest. It raises the height and extends it forward while also giving you a little extra storage compartment.

### Front Bumper Bezels

Initially I cheaped out and bought a set of aftermarket DRL bezels that looked pretty close to OEM but added a JDM-style DRL for a good price. Fitment was decent and they looked good but eventually they started forming a lot of little cracks. OEM bezels, while more expensive, are a much better fit and finish and are designed to last. Buy once cry once.

### Air Intake

I went with GrimmSpeed mainly due to the design of it where it pulls in air from outside the engine bay and still retains the air straightener for the MAF. I don't know how much of a difference the MAF air straightener actually makes but it seems like a good idea. As a bonus, if you have a '20+ front bumper bezel you can remove the back panel on the bezel to allow more air into the passenger wheel well area. The air filter sits slightly below the headlight so water intake shouldn't really be a concern. If you blast some poor soul on the sidewalk ramming through a large puddle though you might need new rods, so maybe don't do that.

![IMG_9006.jpg](https://ndesilets.com/content/images/2023/12/IMG_9006.jpg)
Don't look too closely at my paint chips that looks like someone blasted it with a shotgun.

The stock 2019 air box is decently audible already IMO but this will make it more noticeable without being too crazy.

### Equal Length Header

Went with a Killer B Holy header due to their choice of using 321 stainless steel (more resistant to cracking from higher EGTs in turbo engines over 304) and also the equal length design. I do kind of miss the classic unequal length Subaru sound but this still sounds pretty good to me and has a bit of a unique note still. Plus it's different from the Subaru rumble that I hear all the time anyway living in the PNW. Sound aside, an equal length header just seems better in every other aspect and is probably a reliability mod in itself. You lose the rumble but I feel like you gain so much more (better flow, better scavenging, more consistent EGTs, consistent cylinder temps, more top end, etc.)

### Turbo

The stock turbo with stock parts has pretty good mid range torque starting around 3-3.5K but feels like it dies off towards the top. I wanted something that would give me more top end power without taking away too much away from the low end. The combination of an equal length header and free flowing intake/exhaust with a Dom 1.5 gives you something that feels similar to stock around 3-3.5K except it keeps building power all the way to redline. The 10cm turbine housing I opted for might be a little oversized for the stock heads/cams so the 8cm housing might have been a better choice for me. A 20g would also probably be a good option. That being said, I don't regret getting the Dom 1.5 10cm.

### Catback

~~I wanted something relatively quiet and the GrimmSpeed resonated catback is marketed as basically that. The quality is great, the install was easy, and it sounds pretty good when you're on it without being obnoxiously loud. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely still loud especially with the rest of my parts but not like an ETS Extreme or whatever. The mufflers are pretty large but they're a straight-through design so you have all the flow.~~

~~There is some drone in my setup around 2500-3000rpm. It's not unbearable but it's definitely present and passengers will notice it. I suspect this is partially due to using the polyurethane hangers that it came with since all that noise/vibration is being transmitted more easily into the trunk area now. In the future I'm going to try swapping the poly hangers out with the stock rubber ones/play with sound deadening to see if that reduces some of the drone.~~

~~Anyway, my verdict is if you're mainly the only one in your car the GrimmSpeed resonated catback isn't too bad and sounds good at WOT. I wish it was a little bit quieter overall but I'm fine with it given all the other parts that I have. If you're frequently driving non-car people around I would look for a quieter option. If you're looking for something that's "like stock but a little louder" that's probably only going to be true if you have a stock header/downpipe.~~

I installed an HKS Super Turbo W-Tail catback and it is a night and day difference compared to the GrimmSpeed resonated catback. It's much quieter and doesn't drone around 2500-3000rpm. I tried to convince myself the GrimmSpeed one wasn't that bad at first because it sounded great otherwise but the more I drove it the more I started to hate the drone and the copium wore off. Anyway, would highly recommend this HKS catback if you can find it on sale since it's pricey otherwise.

The only thing to really note on it is that while it's advertised as a 3" catback it actually necks down to 2.5" right at the downpipe flange and uses a donut gasket like the OEM exhaust. I got an adapter for it and it seems fine so far. Still making the same boost and not sure if I notice much on the butt dyno. In the future I may see if I can modify it to a 2-bolt 3" flange so I have a full 3" TBE again. I'm just happy there's no more drone at the moment.

### Oil Pan

I plan on autocrossing this car and beating on it a little more so between that and running increased power I figured going with the Killer B oil pan package would be a good idea. Increased oil capacity and improved baffling and such should be useful when running the car hard.

A windage tray for ants.

### Stock Shortblock

From all that I've heard and read, it seems that running 350-400whp while keeping torque below 400ft-lb seems to be fairly safe for a stock block. There are rumors of the 2019+ STI blocks being able to take more power given that they've been revised with blah blah blah but I don't know how much of that is true. Maybe that gives me a bit of extra headroom, maybe it doesn't.

Josh Bader claims to have had many customers running something like 500-600whp on stock shortblocks, some with over 30-40K tuned miles. My theory is that a proper tune with proper parts at a sane power level should last a good while provided that you maintain it and don't beat the absolute shit out of it 24/7. Time will tell but regardless I have money set aside for when The Bad™ happens.

## Installation

Some things to consider if you plan on doing these things yourself. Written from the perspective of someone who doesn't know what the hell they're doing (me).

### Injectors

When people say this sucks, it's because it does suck. It is doable by yourself but if it's your first time you are probably going to be extremely annoyed and then at the end you'll be like "wow yeah that does suck." YouTube videos make it look easy. Swapping the injectors is pretty straightforward, it's getting to them that is the difficult part.

### Turbo

Had to learn the hard way that a stock location turbo, while it does fit in the stock location, doesn't mean stock fitment. Things aren't just going to bolt in and fit just as they did before. The Blouch 1.5XT-R is a good bit larger than the stock turbo and this can create some fitment issues depending on what other parts you have. Installation is mostly straightforward but you are likely going to run into a few issues:

- With this turbo you will probably need to grind down the turbine housing a bit in order to get it to clear the flange nut for the uppipe stud closest to the wheel well. I used a dremel with a drum sander and it turned out pretty okay.
  - ![IMG_8574.jpg](https://ndesilets.com/content/images/2023/12/IMG_8574.jpg)

  - ![IMG_8635-converted.jpg](https://ndesilets.com/content/images/2023/12/IMG_8635-converted.jpg)

- You will also need a reducer for the wastegate actuator nipple. If I ever remember the sizes I'll update this. For now I was able to find something that worked for me at AutoZone.

- The stock intake elbow pipe will be too short so you will need to get a new 2" silicone elbow pipe and cut it to length. The stock one seems like it'll fit but it ends up being slightly too short when trying to get it onto the turbo.

- If you are using this with an IAG AOS and GrimmSpeed TMIC you will need to get a little creative with pcv hose routing. I don't remember which hose it is atm, but the one that would normally run in between the compressor housing/intercooler will get pinched and you'll need to route it a different way.

- I wasn't able to install the turbo heatshield bracket (so no heatshield atm) because of the increased flange thickness between the turbo and downpipe. I need to find slightly longer bolts for that. For now I have just a turbo blanket.

- When paired with a GrimmSpeed TMIC without the extra shroud they sell (and combined with the above bullet point) there will be a small gap on the passenger side of the intercooler in the hood scoop that will let water fall onto the turbine housing and uppipe studs, which will rust easily. I ended up installing the shroud to alleviate some of this and for better flow into the TMIC but having a heatshield is pretty important to protect the housing/studs from rust IMO.

- Not related to the turbo specifically, but if you order the Killer B uppipe studs like I did you'll find out that they're too long. Flip the studs near the turbo flange otherwise your downpipe isn't going to clear them.

### Oil Pan

This also was not fun mainly due to the 4 rear bolts being in a very difficult spot. You need to jack the engine up off the mounts an inch or two to even be able to get to them. After that good luck don't lose your fingers. If you thought they were a pain to get to with the stock oil pan just wait until you put a larger one on. Also be careful installing the dipstick tube into the oil pan and do it slowly. Make sure the o-rings are lubricated. If those o-rings tear it's going to be a bit of a pain to fix it later on. Of all the parts in this installation, this is probably the one I'd recommend having a shop that knows what they're doing install for you. But if you're stubborn like me you can do it.

### COBB Turbo Inlet

Requires a lot of finagling to install, give yourself a couple/few hours. Don't need to pull the manifold for this.

### AOS

The IAG V3 AOS looks daunting to install and initially seemed difficult, especially looking at the 100+ steps in the guide. It's actually not that bad as long as you have a set of your own constant tension hose clamps. The IAG supplied clamps are mostly fine but are sometimes a pain to deal with unless you have their special pliers. There are however a couple of supplied ring clamps for the block breather hose that were extremely difficult/infuriating to install. I tossed those ring clamps and used my own constant tension clamps and it was pretty much smooth sailing after that. Those ring clamp issues were about the only real problems I had. The rest is just disconnecting/connecting hoses and rerouting some of them.

If your STI has ring clamps from the factory on the PCV hoses you can just pull them off without cutting the hose or the clamps. It might not seem like you can, but you can.
